## QuickBooks Backup
qbbackup.sys is a text/xml file with the file extension .sys

The schedule id is the epoch time when the backup schedule was created by the QuickBooks application.

Intuit does not provide documentation on that the exit codes mean, but I see more files exit with exit code 2 than exit code 0 so I made the assumption that exit code 2 is success.  
Additionally, the files that exited with exit code 0 do not produce a qbb file in the backup destination.
